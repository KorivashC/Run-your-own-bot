Twitch API CLI/wrapper

EZ Twitch (or Easy Twitch, eztw for short) is a Twitch API CLI and wrapper written in JavaScript for the NPM registry.

# IMPORTANT
This package is no longer supported because we moved to a different registry. Check it out [here!](https://www.npmjs.com/package/eztw)

## CLI
Every function of our CLI is documented in [our documentation](https://github.com/Rediverse/eztwitch/wiki/The-CLI), which is worth to check out!

## Wrapper
The wrapper is documented in [our documentation](https://github.com/Rediverse/eztwitch/wiki/The-Wrapper) too!
